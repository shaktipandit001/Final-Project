# COGS App Project Overview

## Project Description
The COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) App is designed to streamline and optimize inventory, waste, purchasing, and sales management for businesses in the food industry. By integrating comprehensive tracking and forecasting functionalities, the app aims to reduce waste, improve inventory turnover, and enhance decision-making processes.

## Project Goal
The goal of the COGS App is to provide a robust, user-friendly platform that enables businesses to efficiently manage their inventory, reduce waste, streamline purchasing, and accurately forecast sales. This will help businesses optimize their operations, reduce costs, and increase profitability.

- **Waste Analysis:** Analyze waste patterns to identify areas for improvement.

### 3. Purchasing Management
- **Purchase Logging:** Log all purchases made from suppliers.
- **Supplier Information:** Maintain supplier information and purchase history.
- **Reorder Management:** Manage reorder levels and automate purchase orders.

### 4. Sales Management
- **Sales Tracking:** Track all sales transactions.
- **Sales Categorization:** Categorize sales by product type, customer segment, and sales channels.
- **Sales Analysis:** Monitor sales trends and seasonal patterns.

### 5. Recipe Management
- **Recipe Storage:** Store and manage recipes for all food items.
- **Ingredient Calculation:** Calculate ingredient requirements based on sales forecasts.
- **Recipe Adjustment:** Adjust recipes based on ingredient availability and cost.

### 6. Sales Forecasting
- **Historical Data Analysis:** Use historical sales data to predict future sales.
- **Forecasting Models:** Implement forecasting models .
- **Long-Term Forecasting:** Forecast sales for the next five years to aid in strategic planning.

## Development Steps

### 1. Data Collection and Storage
- **Database Setup:** Set up a database to store data related to inventory, waste, purchases, sales, and recipes.
- **Database Choice:** Use a relational database based on needs.

### 2. Data Processing and Cleaning

- **Data Handling:** Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Data Understanding:** Perform EDA to understand data distribution and relationships.
- **Visualizations:** Use visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to identify patterns and trends.
- **Summary Statistics:** Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).

### 4. Feature Engineering
- **New Features:** Create new features to improve forecasting models .
- **Variable Encoding:** Encode categorical variables and normalize numerical features.

### 5. Model Selection and Training
- **Model Choice:** Choose appropriate forecasting models (e.g. Random Forest,etc).
- **Model Training:** Train models using historical sales data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate models .

### 6. Sales Forecasting
- **Forecast Generation:** Generate sales forecasts for the next five years.
- **Periodic Updates:** Update forecasts periodically as new data becomes available.

### 7. Application Development
- **User Interface:** Develop a user-friendly interface for managing inventory, waste, purchases, sales, and recipes.
- **Frameworks:** Use web development frameworks (?).
- **Security:** Implement authentication and authorization for data security.
