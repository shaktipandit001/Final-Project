    "# COGS App Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "The COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) App is designed to streamline and optimize inventory, waste, purchasing, and sales management for businesses in the food industry. By integrating comprehensive tracking and forecasting functionalities, the app aims to reduce waste, improve inventory turnover, and enhance decision-making processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Goal\n",
    "The goal of the COGS App is to provide a robust, user-friendly platform that enables businesses to efficiently manage their inventory, reduce waste, streamline purchasing, and accurately forecast sales. This will help businesses optimize their operations, reduce costs, and increase profitability.\n",
